## Impala Setup

* The (main stream) query engines in my eye
  * [Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home)
  * [Impala + Parquet](http://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/)
  * [Presto + ORC](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/)
  * Spark SQL doesn't expose an interface to external programs (such as JDBC or ODBC), so it's a tool for Spark only
